TODO:
* add button for players to add card to the river.
* maybe prevent tiles to be deleted, they must be discarded (or discard on deletion?)
* add way to take a card back from the table to the river.
* clean sync river after hand discard from the GM ------ Discard Entire Hand should not discard river --- not sure because this helps recover from issues...
* limit right click options on river cards.
* --allow roll with boost instead of auto-boosting since this will be removed--
* skills have a score now and can be rolled
* improve statuses (injury, etc) to show stress mitigation and description of what it does?
* connections can be rolled and have a score
* moxie is now called stress
* Features is called Perks
* show river cards differently in the hand and table would be a plus

BUGS:
* Clicking fast can go over river limits (hard to reproduce)
* Dropping cards x,y position is in relation to local screen, not GM's screen, which means the card is dropped wherever.
* Notes is written all smol
* draw to river only available from players deck (its not bad, when clicking on it from GMs deck, it draws in players deck anyways)
* when player draw cards from their deck its finnicky... there is certainly an issue with slots because I lose 1 card if the GM adds 4 cards to river and I draw 3 from deck from a player, i lose 1 river card...
